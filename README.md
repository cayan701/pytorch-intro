# PyTorch Introduction

This README provides a basic introduction to PyTorch, a popular open-source machine learning framework.

## What is PyTorch?

PyTorch is a Python-based scientific computing package serving two broad purposes:

* **A replacement for NumPy to use the power of GPUs:** PyTorch leverages GPUs for accelerated tensor computations, significantly speeding up machine learning tasks.
* **A deep learning research platform that provides maximum flexibility and speed:** Its dynamic computation graph allows for easy experimentation and debugging, making it a favorite among researchers.

## Key Features

* **Tensors:** PyTorch's fundamental data structure, similar to NumPy arrays but with GPU acceleration.
* **Dynamic Computation Graph:** Defines the computational graph on the fly, enabling flexible model architectures.
* **Automatic Differentiation (Autograd):** Automatically computes gradients for backpropagation, simplifying the training process.
* **GPU Acceleration:** Seamlessly utilizes GPUs for faster computations.
* **Extensive Library:** Offers a rich library of modules for building and training neural networks.
* **Pythonic:** Integrates smoothly with the Python ecosystem.
* **Community and Ecosystem:** Large and active community with numerous pre-trained models and tools.

## Installation

You can install PyTorch using `pip` or `conda`. For specific installation instructions, refer to the official PyTorch website: [https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)

**Example (using pip):**

```bash
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio
